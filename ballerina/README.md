## Overview

Azure OpenAI Service provides access to OpenAI's powerful language models within the Microsoft Azure platform.

The Azure OpenAI connector offers APIs for connecting with Azure OpenAI Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling the integration of advanced conversational AI, text generation, and language processing capabilities into applications.

### Key Features

- Connect and interact with Azure OpenAI Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Support for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and other advanced OpenAI models
- Seamless integration with Azure AI infrastructure
- Secure communication with API key and token authentication

## Prerequisites

Before using this module in your Ballerina application, first you must obtain the nessary configuration to engage the LLM.

- Create an [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/azure-portal/) account.
- Create an [Azure OpenAI resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/create-resource).
- Obtain the tokens. Refer to the [Azure OpenAI Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference#authentication) guide to learn how to generate and use tokens.

## Quickstart

To use the `ai.azure` module in your Ballerina application, update the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

Import the `ai.azure;` module.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/ai.azure;
```

### Step 2: Intialize the Model Provider

Here's how to initialize the Model Provider:

```ballerina
import ballerina/ai;
import ballerinax/ai.azure;

final ai:ModelProvider  azureOpenAiModel = check new azure:OpenAiModelProvider("https://service-url", "api-key", "deployment-id", "deployment-version");
```

### Step 4: Invoke chat completion

```ballerina
ai:ChatMessage[] chatMessages = [{role: "user", content: "hi"}];
ai:ChatAssistantMessage response = check azureOpenAiModel->chat(chatMessages, tools = []);

chatMessages.push(response);
```
